# Tic-Tac-Toe with Python Classes

In this lab, I utilized **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** by building a Tic-Tac-Toe terminal game.

## Overview
The goal is to reinforce understanding of OOP concepts, such as creating and using classes, methods, and attributes.


## Game logic Functions
     - `print_board()`: Display the current game board.
     - `get_move()`: Prompt and validate the player's move.
     - `check_for_winner()`: Determine if there is a winner or a draw.
